The Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) is a yearly event hosted by the University of Waterloo. The past contests are available through the link below.

[https://cemc.math.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#ccc](https://cemc.math.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#ccc)

## This assignment requires you to:
- Create a WebAPI Method which solves a J1 Problem
- Create a WebAPI Method which solves a J2 Problem
- Initiative: Create a WebAPI Method that attempts a J3 or higher problem.
  
The questions on the CCC assume that the program input works through a terminal. Below are two example questions which have been
modified to work with WebAPI HTTP request inputs rather than terminal inputs. You may solve the two examples below; or look through the past
contests for problems.
